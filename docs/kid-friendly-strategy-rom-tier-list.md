# Kid-friendly strategic ROM tier list

This list is aimed at a 10-year-old player and prioritizes low time pressure, clear goals, and low frustration.
Within each tier, entries are ordered by graphical fidelity (higher first).

## S tier (best starting picks)
- **Pokemon Crystal** (GBC) - turn-based, easy to play in short sessions
- **Pokemon Trading Card Game** (GBC) - strategy-first, no action stress
- **Pokemon Yellow** (GB) - turn-based, very low reflex pressure
- **Mario's Picross** (GB) - calm logic puzzles
- **Mole Mania** (GB) - puzzle/adventure with gentle challenge
- **Boxxle** (GB) - simple push-block strategy puzzles
- **Kwirk** (GB) - clean puzzle design, beginner-friendly
- **Catrap** (GB) - puzzle platforming with rewind-style problem solving

## A tier (good next step)
- **Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine** (Genesis) - puzzle strategy with only mild speed pressure
- **Columns** (Genesis / Game Gear / Master System) - simple matching puzzle, easy to learn
- **The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX** (GBC) - light action with lots of thinking
- **Bomberman Quest** (GBC) - simple RPG structure, not too punishing
- **Harvest Moon GBC** (GBC) - planning-focused and relaxing

## B tier (strategy-heavy or more complex)
- **Shining Force II** (Genesis) - turn-based tactical RPG, more reading
- **Shining Force** (Genesis) - tactical battles and planning, a bit harder than A tier picks
- **Crystal Warriors** (Game Gear) - tactical RPG, strategic but less beginner-friendly
- **Shining Force: The Sword of Hajya** (Game Gear) - tactical RPG with more challenge
- **Battle Chess** (NES) - fun presentation, still true chess difficulty
- **The Chessmaster** (NES) - good chess option, but menu-heavy
- **Nobunaga's Ambition** (NES) - deep strategy, likely hard for younger kids
- **Romance of the Three Kingdoms II** (NES) - deep and slow, best with help

## Connect 4 / chess note
